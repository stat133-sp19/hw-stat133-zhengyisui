## Overview

`"binomial"` is a minimal package 
that provides functions to execute basic functions of binomial distribution.

* `bin_choose()` computes the number of success given trials.
* `bin_cumulative()` compute cumulative distribution given trials and success probability.
* `bin_distribution()` compute distribution given trials and success probability.
* `bin_kurtosis()` compute kurtosis given trials and success probability.
* `bin_mean()` compute mean given trials and success probability.
* `bin_mode()` compute mode given trials and success probability.
* `bin_probability()` compute probability given sucess, trials and success probability.
* `bin_skewness()` compute skewness given trials and success probability.
* `bin_variable()` show variables of trials and success probability.
* `bin_variance()` compute variance given trials and success probability.
* `plot.bincum()` plot the cumulatative distribution given trials and success probability.
* `print.binvar()` print the `bin_variable` object.
* `print.summary.binvar()` print the summary of `bin_variable` object.
* `bin_varisummary.binvarable()` show the summary of `bin_variable` object.

## Usage
```{r}
bin_choose(3, 2)
bin_probability(2, 3, 0.5)
bin_distribution(3, 0.5)
plot(bin_distribution(3, 0.5))
bin_cumulative(3, 0.5)
plot(bin_cumulative(3, 0.5))
bin_variable(3, 0.5)
summary(bin_variable(3, 0.5))
bin_mean(3, 0.5)
bin_variance(3, 0.5)
bin_mode(3, 0.5)
bin_kurtosis(3, 0.5)
bin_skewness(3, 0.5)
```
